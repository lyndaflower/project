            <p>The safety actions of our employees and co-workers are driven from choice, not just from formal compliance. Like family, we look out for each other each day – at home, in the office and on our construction projects, we are committed to ensuring that everyone returns home safely each night.</p>

             <p>In general, <strong>the construction industry</strong> still primarily relies on manual processes and other point solutions to monitor site operations and safety, and track important project information. It is not uncommon, for example, for an injured individual to rely on another worker to leave his/her work area and get help, or for supervisors to manually gather incident details and paper witness statements.</P>
             
            <p> Not only do these manual tasks delay incident reporting and response (and potentially increase injury severity), but they also trap important information at the job site — presenting a significant challenge for risk managers responsible for corporate risk structure and strategy across all active projects.</p>
